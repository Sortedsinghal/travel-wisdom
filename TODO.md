# TODO for Implementing Backpacking Trips Page

- [ ] Create src/pages/BackpackingTrips.tsx with the page structure including Header, Footer, centered title "Backpacking Trips You ❤️", and a responsive grid of exactly 4 trip cards matching the provided images (using appropriate images from public/trip/, titles like "Leh 6 Nights Trip", prices, and buttons "Trip Details" and "Enquire Now").

- [ ] Edit src/App.tsx to add import for BackpackingTrips and the new Route for path="/backpacking-trips".

- [ ] Edit src/components/Header.tsx to update the "Backpacking Trips" dropdown trigger from <a href="#"> to <Link to="/backpacking-trips">.

- [ ] Followup: Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server, verify the page loads at /backpacking-trips, the header link navigates correctly, and the cards render as expected. Use browser_action if needed to inspect.
